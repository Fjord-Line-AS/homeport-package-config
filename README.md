**Main features**:

- Tabbed form-based UI for rule creation
- Live draft and validation system
- Admin-only access via a protected interface
- Server-side Sanity integration for real-time persistence

**Target users**: Internal Fjord Line staff managing travel packages.

**Tech stack**:

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **CMS**: Sanity.io
- **Validation**: Zod
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS + custom components

/app/actions/              # Server actions for CRUD operations
/components/admin/         # Admin-only UI components like PackageRuleForm
/lib/sanity/               # Sanity client, query helpers, fetch utilities
/lib/validation/           # Zod schemas and validation functions
/app/admin/package-rules/  # Admin page and routing logic for package rules
```

### 3. **Data Model**

The `PackageRule_v2` Sanity type defines the schema for all rule data:

- **Top-level fields**: `title`, `status`, `validFrom`, `validTo`, etc.
- **Nested structures**:

  - **Ports**: `fromPorts`, `toPorts`
  - **Persons**: age groups, counts
  - **Dates**: weekdays, date ranges
  - **Accommodation**: cabins, hotel codes, restrictions

---

### 4. **Form System**

- Core UI lives in `PackageRuleForm` component
- Uses a tabbed layout for categories like journey, persons, dates, accommodation, etc.
- Zod schema (`packageRuleSchema`) validates data per tab
- Uses localStorage to persist drafts with automatic recovery

---

### 5. **Sanity Integration**

- Server actions:

  - `createPackageRule()`
  - `updatePackageRule()`
  - `deletePackageRule()`

- Server components handle Sanity reference data fetching
- Real-time updates are optionally supported using Sanityâ€™s hooks

---

### 6. **Client vs Server**

- Data fetching always occurs server-side using `sanityFetch()`
- Client components only handle UI, interaction, and local state
- Sanity references are resolved on the server for performance & security

---

### 7. **Draft System**

- LocalStorage stores in-progress rules as JSON
- `usePackageRuleDraftWatcher` listens for unsaved changes
- Utilities:

  - `getPackageRuleDraft(id)`
  - `clearPackageRuleDraft(id)`

---

### 8. **Validation & Progress Tracking**

- `validatePackageRule()` validates entire rule object
- Each tab has granular validation logic
- Progress is calculated based on number of valid sections vs total
- Errors are displayed as badges and sidebar messages

---

### 9. **UI/UX Components**

- Visual components:

  - Rule cards, pill badges, list views
  - Icon system for section states

- Form features:

  - Tabbed nav with validation state
  - Sidebar with section tips and links

---

### 10. **CRUD Flow**

- **Create**:

  - New rule button â†’ `PackageRuleForm`
  - Draft stored in localStorage
  - Save triggers `createPackageRule()`

- **Edit**:

  - Loads server data into form
  - Auto-merges with draft if present

- **Delete**:

  - Confirmation modal â†’ `deletePackageRule()`

---

### 11. **Known Issues / Gotchas**

- After updating, the watcher may fire due to state mismatch, causing false drafts
- Weekdays checkboxes sometimes don't reflect correct state on first render
- Validation messages may mismatch display badges (especially for accommodation tab)
